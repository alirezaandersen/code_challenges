require 'pry'

# The problem is to implement a function that converts a given phrase to its
# acronym. The function should accept the phrase as input and print or return
# the acronym as its output. Your code should be compilable/runnable.

# Examples:
#  - Portable Network Graphics => PNG
#  - First In, First Out => FIFO
#  - Asynchronous Javascript and XML => AJAX
#  - GNU Image Manipulation Program => GIMP
#  - Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor => CMOS
#  - Something - I made up from thin air => SIMUFTA
